    "g method steps:\n",
    "1. The altitude is fixed (thus, $\\rho_\\infty$ is known; the speed of sound at that altitude is not enforced). The Mach number Mâˆž is also fixed.\n",
    "2. The maximum frequency $k_\\mathrm{max}$ of interest is determined. The minimum frequency $k_\\mathrm{min}$ is selected to be zero (steady case). A range of speeds of potential interest is selected: $V_{\\infty,\\,\\mathrm{min}}$ and $V_{\\infty,\\,\\mathrm{max}}$ are decided at this stage.\n",
    "3. The size of reduced frequency increments $\\Delta k$ is decided.\n",
    "4. At each step $j$ of the iterative procedure of the g method, the reduced frequency used in the aerodynamic model is incremented: $k_j = k_{j-1} + \\delta k$. At this stage the velocity $V_\\infty$ is kept constant.\n",
    "5. Using the fixed values of $\\rho_\\infty$, $M_\\infty$, and $k_j$, the aerodynamic solver provides the dimensionless generalized aerodynamic force matrix $\\tilde{\\bm{A}}\\left(ik_j, M_\\infty\\right)$, and then the matrices $\\bm{C}_0$, $\\bm{C}_1$, and $\\bm{C}_2$ are determined. Matrix $\\bm{D}$ is formed.\n",
    "6. A sign change of the imaginary part of each eigenvalue $g_{i,j}$ is sought (notice the notation: $g_{i,j}$ means the eigenvalue with identity $i$ evaluated in the current step $j$ of increments for the reduced frequency $k_j$). Notice that $g$ must be a real quantity. This is the reason why only the imaginary part equal to zero has physical meaning that is relevant from an engineering point of view.\n",
    "7. If $\\mathrm{Im}\\left(g_{i,j}\\right) = 0$ (within a tolerance in the practice) and $g_{i,j} > 0$, then the system is unstable and flutter occurred. To find the correct reduced frequency of instability, a linear interpolation is performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\dfrac{k_j - k_{j-1}}{g_{i,j} - g_{i,j-1}} = \\dfrac{k_\\mathrm{flutter} - k_{j-1}}{0 - g_{i,j-1}}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus it follows that the flutter reduced frequency, velocity and frequency are respectively:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "k_\\mathrm{flutter} = k_{j-1} - g_{i,j-1}\\dfrac{k_j - k_{j-1}}{g_{i,j} - g_{i,j-1}},\\\\[1em]\n",
    "V_{\\infty,\\,\\mathrm{flutter}} = V_\\infty,\\\\[1em]\n",
    "w_\\mathrm{flutter} = \\dfrac{k_\\mathrm{flutter}V_{\\infty,\\,\\mathrm{flutter}}}{b}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This flutter speed in general violates the condition $M_\\infty = V_{\\infty,\\,\\mathrm{flutter}}/c_\\infty$. Thus several analyses need to be conducted to find the matched flutter point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are going to demonstrate the g method using Theodorsen's theory for unsteady aerodynamics."
